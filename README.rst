Fork Notice
================
This is a forked repository. Have a look at
samusâ€™s mongodb-csharp wiki
for more basic information.

Fork Reason
================
This fork is to provider a fuller framework for integrating into C# or VB.NET. The goal is to provide the feature sets of full blown OR/Ms (NHibernate, EntityFramework) such as POCO objects, change tracking, and Linq support.

We will do our best to keep up-to-date with the driver implemenation here so as to reap the benefits of their work. Eventually, we would like to merge back so as not to have 2 projects.

Thanks
================
Much of this work is made possible by the contributions of Gnomony(http://www.gnomony.com).
